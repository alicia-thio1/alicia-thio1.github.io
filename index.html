	Hobbes' State of Nature
</h1>
	<h2>
		State of Nature: an uncivilized, primordial state of humanity before the creation of society
		Thomas Hobbes: an English Philosopher in the 17th century
		</h2>
<p>
In his book, the <i> Leviathan </i>, Thomas Hobbes described his bleak belief of what our state of nature theoretically looked like. Man, according to Hobbes, is driven completely by self-interest, where we hedonisticly seek solely to avoid pain and maximize pleasure. However, when there's conflict of interest (say that two people have their sights set on one object), in order to achieve that pleasure of ownership of the object, we WILL kill. Homocide
