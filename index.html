<h2>
Hobbes' State of Nature ~ Philosophical History
</h2>
		
<h3>
State of Nature: an uncivilized, primordial state of humanity before the creation of society
<br> 
Thomas Hobbes: an English Philosopher in the 17th century
</h3>

In his book, the <i> Leviathan </i>, Thomas Hobbes described his bleak belief of what our state of nature theoretically looked like. Man, according to Hobbes, is driven completely by self-interest, where we hedonisticly seek solely to avoid pain and maximize pleasure. However, when there's conflict of interest (say that two people have their sights set on one object), in order to achieve that pleasure of ownership of the object, we will kill. Murder would be our solution to satisfy the distribution of finite resources to infinite wants. Today, homocide seems immoral, and simply wrong. However, in the State of Nature, according to Hobbes, morality simply does not exist. Nothing is moral or immoral, it is simply amoral. Our state of nature is completely void of morality, conscience, and law; which leads to our only right, accordint to Hobbes, of absolute freedom. Without laws or conscience, what's to stop us from taking a human life? We're free to exercise our absolute freedom in whatever we choose in this state of lawlessnes; isn't this extremely bleak? Hobbes differs from other philosophers on his views of our State of Nature in that his State of Nature is void of God, there is no divine force present. But of course, we don't live in such a state of lawlessness today, so what did Hobbes believe must have happened for us to create society?

<h2>
Marx's Alienation of Labor in the Communist Manifesto
</h2>

<h3>
~ How Capitalism dehumanizes the worker. according to Marx ~ (i hate this guy)
</h3>

<div id = "p1">
	<p>
Marx believes that capitalism initiates the alienation of labor in a worker. This occurs in three stages, the alienation of the worker from his product, then the alienation of the worker from labor itself, and finally the alienation of the worker from his species-being, from what makes his human. Essentially, Marx argues that a capitalist society and private property dehumanize the worker. 
In capitalism, the worker is unnaturally separated from his creation, the product of his labor. In theory, a creator should own his creation, but this is not the case. A factory worker in an assembly line has no ownership to the caps he screws on bottles; when people use his products, the worker isn’t even acknowledged. All his fruits of labor go back to the owner of the factory, rather than the worker himself. Even though he may pour in an abundance of effort into his object of labor, he receives nothing back from it. Whilst in a communist society, anybody has partial ownership to everything he contributes, as that object now becomes a communal piece of property; creator and creation will not be completely separated in terms of ownership. 
 As a consequence of being denied ownership to the fruits of his labor, the state of working itself starts to feel unnatural as well. This discomfort in working results in us taking solace in our more animalistic, basic activities, like eating, drinking, and sleeping; even though Marx believed that initially we were (and still are) fulfilled by labor (which is supposedly our human function), rather than those animalistic functions. 
 So then we take comfort in our animal functions and find discomfort in labor; however, Marx claims that labor is essentially what separates us from animals. So this discomfort in labor causes an alienation from our species-being, from what makes us human. This dehumanization of the worker is all caused by capitalism, claims Marx.

<h2>
Mises' Calculation Problem</h2>

<h3>
How socialism destroys wealth purely from a logical and economical standpoint
<br>
~ Ludwig Mises' Argument Against Socialism ~
</h3>

<div id = "p1">
	<p>
Mises’ Calculation Problem points out a major flaw in socialism; there’s no way to make comparisons, calculations, and decisions as rational and efficient as capitalism can, due to a lack of a basic monetary standard to reduce decisions to and compare them by. Take this hypothetical: A railroad company needs to decide whether to build around a mountain in their way, over the mountain, or through the mountain.
 In capitalism, they can decide which route would be most efficient due to free market prices, allowing them to assign values to their costs and compare them against each alternative. All these factors of consideration (maintenance, materials, time, workers), can somewhat be reduced to a homogeneous standard, money. The most efficient decision would produce the most benefits in proportion to their costs. However, in a socialist/communist society, there are no free market prices and no monetary standard to measure by, so the government in charge of building the railroad would have to guess which route would be most efficient. Guessing is most definitely not efficient; there’s no guarantee that they’ll be right every single time; there’s a greater chance that they’ll be wrong almost every single time. This leads to inefficient decisions, leading to the destruction of wealth. 
In capitalism, if a business is inefficient, it’s punished by the market, as in it won’t produce profits as much anymore and it loses money. If it’s constantly inefficient, it goes out of business, and is replaced by another more efficient company; this creates wealth. However, none of this exists in communism. Communism and socialism only destroy wealth.
