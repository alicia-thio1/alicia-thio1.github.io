	Hobbes' State of Nature

		State of Nature: an uncivilized, primordial state of humanity before the creation of society
		Thomas Hobbes: an English Philosopher in the 17th century

<p>
In his book, the <i> Leviathan </i>, Thomas Hobbes described his bleak belief of what our state of nature theoretically looked like. Man, according to Hobbes, is driven completely by self-interest, where we hedonisticly seek solely to avoid pain and maximize pleasure. However, when there's conflict of interest (say that two people have their sights set on one object), in order to achieve that pleasure of ownership of the object, we WILL kill. Murder would be our solution to satisfy the distribution of finite resources to infinite wants. Today, homocide seems immoral, and simply wrong. However, in the State of Nature, according to Hobbes, morality simply does not exist. Nothing is moral or immoral, it is simply amoral. Our state of nature is completely void of morality, conscience, and law; which leads to our only right, accordint to Hobbes, of absolute freedom. Without laws or conscience, what's to stop us from taking a human life? We're free to exercise our absolute freedom in whatever we choose in this state of lawlessnes; isn't this extremely bleak? Hobbes differs from other philosophers on his views of our State of Nature in that his State of Nature is void of God, there is no divine force present. But of course, we don't live in such a state of lawlessness today, so what did Hobbes believe must have happened for us to create society?
